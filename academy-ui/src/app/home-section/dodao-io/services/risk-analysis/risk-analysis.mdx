### **DoDAO’s On-Chain Risk Analysis: Simplified Approach**

At DoDAO, we offer advanced on-chain risk measurement services to ensure that DeFi protocols remain safe and resilient in different market conditions. Our risk analysis platform uses various proven models to provide accurate risk assessments. Here’s a simple breakdown of how we help measure on-chain risk:

---

#### **1. Monte Carlo Simulations**

- **What It Does**: This model runs thousands of “what-if” scenarios to predict how a protocol will behave in different market conditions.
- **How It Helps**: By running these simulations, we can see how a protocol might respond to sudden market swings or crashes. This allows us to estimate the chances of large losses or liquidations happening.
- **Example**: Imagine if the price of ETH drops by 50% in a few hours—Monte Carlo simulations show how this could affect users' collateral and the protocol’s ability to manage this crisis.

#### **2. GARCH Model (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**

- **What It Does**: This model helps us predict price movements by analyzing how market volatility changes over time.
- **How It Helps**: GARCH allows us to forecast how asset prices like ETH or BTC might fluctuate, making it easier to plan for sudden price changes that could lead to higher risk for borrowers and lenders.
- **Example**: If ETH has been experiencing price spikes, GARCH can help predict if that trend will continue or calm down, allowing the protocol to adjust its risk parameters.

#### **3. Correlated GARCH (Multivariate GARCH)**

- **What It Does**: This is an advanced version of GARCH that looks at how different assets (like ETH and BTC) move together.
- **How It Helps**: It lets us understand how the price of one asset affects another, giving a clearer picture of overall risk in multi-asset portfolios. This is especially important for protocols that support lending or borrowing with multiple cryptocurrencies.
- **Example**: If ETH and BTC are strongly correlated, a drop in ETH might also mean a drop in BTC. This helps us predict more accurately how users’ portfolios will react.

#### **4. Agent-Based Simulations**

- **What It Does**: These simulations mimic how different participants (like lenders, borrowers, and liquidators) behave in various market conditions.
- **How It Helps**: We simulate real user behavior to predict how people will act during stressful events, such as a market crash or a spike in gas fees. This provides insights into how these actions will impact the protocol’s overall health.
- **Example**: We can simulate what would happen if a large borrower fails to repay a loan during a price drop and how quickly liquidators would step in to stabilize the market.

#### **5. Economic Security Index**

- **What It Does**: This index measures how resilient a protocol is against economic exploits, like market manipulation or liquidity shortages.
- **How It Helps**: It gives a clear score that reflects the protocol's ability to protect users and funds from potential threats.
- **Example**: By understanding how much loss the protocol can handle before becoming vulnerable, we help identify areas where the system might need improvement.

#### **6. Value at Risk (VaR)**

- **What It Does**: VaR calculates the maximum loss a protocol might experience over a specific time period under normal market conditions.
- **How It Helps**: This metric gives an upper limit on potential losses, helping protocols plan their risk management strategies accordingly.
- **Example**: For a protocol like Compound, VaR might show how much of its reserves could be lost in a worst-case scenario, helping them decide on necessary adjustments to borrowing limits.

---

#### **7. Liquidations at Risk (LaR)**

- **What It Does**: LaR focuses on the risk of liquidations happening in specific market scenarios.
- **How It Helps**: This measure lets us predict when and how liquidations might occur, ensuring the protocol can manage these events smoothly without destabilizing the market.
- **Example**: If multiple users have borrowed against ETH, LaR shows when they might be liquidated if ETH’s price drops, helping protocols prepare for this.

---

#### **8. Profit Function for Liquidators**

- **What It Does**: This function calculates how profitable it is for liquidators to step in and buy assets from borrowers in liquidation.
- **How It Helps**: Understanding liquidator behavior ensures that they will continue to support the protocol during stress events, which keeps the system balanced and safe.
- **Example**: When a borrower defaults, the profit function determines if it’s worth it for liquidators to buy the borrower’s collateral and help stabilize the protocol.
