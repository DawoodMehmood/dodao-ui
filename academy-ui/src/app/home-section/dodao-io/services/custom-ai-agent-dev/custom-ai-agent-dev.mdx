### **How Does an AI Agent Work?**

AI agents follow a systematic process to achieve their objectives:

1. **Receiving Instructions:** The user provides prompts or tasks for the AI agent.
2. **Perceiving the Environment:** The AI agent gathers information using external tools and contextual inputs.
3. **Goal Setting:** It establishes a clear objective and, if needed, breaks it into smaller, manageable goals.
4. **Planning:** The agent devises a strategy to achieve the goal efficiently.
5. **Decision-Making:** It determines the best path or actions to reach the desired outcome.
6. **Execution:** The agent performs the required actions based on its plan.
7. **Learning from Feedback:** The AI agent uses feedback to refine its processes and improve future performance.
