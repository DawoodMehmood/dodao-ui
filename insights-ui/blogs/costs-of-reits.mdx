### **Essential vs. Less Essential Costs**

Some costs are **essential** because they are necessary for the REIT to function effectively and comply with legal, financial, and operational requirements. These include **general and administrative costs, employee compensation and benefits, board compensation, legal and audit fees, directors’ and officers’ insurance, and property operating expenses**. Without these expenses, the company would struggle to manage its properties, meet regulatory obligations, and maintain investor confidence.
