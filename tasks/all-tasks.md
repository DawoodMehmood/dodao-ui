Must have features



# 1st Priority

### Clickable Demos
- [ ] View modal - the top bar is not visible on some of the steps (i guess where the demo step has a tooltip that is closer to the bottom of the screen) - see step#4 onwards `https://alchemix.tidbitshub.org/clickable-demos/view/withdraw-from-transmuter-8288`
- [ ] View modal - only looks fine above 1024px, down that its all a mess so we can detect the screen size and show a message like view the demo on a large screen
- [ ] Edit modal - remove showing of url from upload fields - new design is needed

### Login issue for admins
- [ ] Go to /login on a subdomain:
  - [ ] (for tidbitshub only) if not logged in then single section modal is showing but behind it Full Screen Modal is showing - just gotta make the single section modal background opacity-100 for this flow only
  
- ### Tidbit
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - add help text somewhere around the image selector
- [ ] Edit modal - remove showing of url from upload fields - new design is needed

### Short videos
- [ ] Edit modal - remove showing of url from upload fields - new design is needed

### Post signup - Help text

# 2nd Priority

### Others
- [ ] Remove the hardcoded messages of notifications and errors. Make use of `default.json` file for all the messages 

### Clickable Demos
- [ ] View modal - we can show a "Try it" button when clickable demo gets completed which takes user to some link relevant to the demo
- [ ] Edit modal - add border to tooltip position dropdown
- [ ] Edit modal - errors at the bottom (before save button) are in reverse order

### Login issue for admins
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button. May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?
  
### Tidbits
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - image uploader - if gif is uploaded, edit and trash icon doesnt appear 
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - icon to duplicate a step 
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - bit of padding left & right for the closed accordion content (name+arrow)
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - add border to image display mode dropdown
- [ ] Edit modal - Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we 
can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new 
users - Skipped
- [ ] Edit modal - Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons - Skipped
  
### Tidbit Collections
- [ ] homepage - Have a way to separate the tidbits and clickable demos so that its clear to the user
- [ ] homepage - whole entity (tidbit/clickable demo/short video) tile should be clickable
- [ ] homepage - entity tile should change background color when hovered over
- [ ] homepage - ellipsis of the last entity is getting cut off
- [ ] homepage - sort items - make the tidbits arrangeable through drag and drop 


### Home page
