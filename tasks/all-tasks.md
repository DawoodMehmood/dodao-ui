# Signup/Login on Tidbitshub
- [ ] On the single section Modal - make it transparent(may be 50% or something) - Dawood

# Signup email text and styling
- [ ] The email that is sent to the user after signup should be styled properly.
- [ ] The email should have a proper subject line


# Login issue for admins
- [ ] ellipsis not visible against tidbits on subdomain, when a user clicks on the space he is an admin of in the list - Dawood to verify
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
  May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?

# Tidbits
- [ ] Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we 
can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new
