# Demos Extension
- [ ] input still needs to be clicked more than once to get it into focus
- [ ] In extension when taking the screenshot, use height of viewport instead of the height of the page - Sami

# Clickable Demos
- [ ] Overlay shows over the buttons - Sami
- [ ] tooltips are not appearing correctly for the new iframe changes
- [ ] modal's cross button outline getting cutoff - (clickable demo view)


# Login issue for admins
- [ ] the admin is not able to login to the subdomain from list of spaces
- [ ] ellipsis not visible against tidbits on subdomain, when a user clicks on the space he is an admin of in the list - Dawood to verify
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
  May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?

# Tidbits
- [ ] Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we 
can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new 
users - Skipped
- [ ] Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons - Skipped

# View Tidbit Collections
- [ ] Have a way to separate the tidbits and clickable demos so that its clear to the user


# Post signup - Help text

- [ ] Add couple of clickable demos. One for creating tidbit, and other for creating a clickable demo.


# Home page styling
- Styling fixes for large screen as currently the content is not properly aligned


# Extension
- [ ] The input box is not focused for some scenarios. Try creating demo of transaction builder, or check with Dawood
- [ ] Remove the options from the extension. 
- [ ] Try capturing 15-20 screenshots and see if we get any error. 
- [ ] Add a close button on the bottom bar which can close the extension. Discuss the design before implementing
