# View Clickable Demos
- [x] When the demo is done show a green tick mark on the demo like we show on the completed tidbits

# Creation/Editing Bytes
- [ ] The creation error is always the "oops something went wrong" should'nt it be specific.
- [ ] Also how would the new user know that what things he can add in the tidbit as i had to find the question adding 
option(solution we can add tooltips for the icons)
- [ ] The size of the text box is too large
- [ ] Full stepper needs adjustments to mae it look good

Are we using the priority and tags fields anywhere, if not, we can then remove them.    Sami
Step Contents field could be made smaller.  Dawood
Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons.    Skipped
Upload image modal needs to be styled better.   Dawood
We get these generic errors like `Validation Error: Can't Save Byte`, the user doesn't know what exactly is the error.
If a step has an error, it just shows `This step has an error`, doesn't really tell about the error. May be we should add real time validation and not wait until the user clicks on Upload button.     Sami
Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new users.    Skipped
Hide the scrollbars from stepper accordion. Dawood
Add hover tooltip on the icons on `Completion Screen` accordion.   Sami
The `trash` icon (for deleting) on the `Completion Screen` doesn't work.    Sami
Placeholders missing from fields in `Completion Screen` accordion.  Sami
Use slightly bigger font on the accordion where we are showing the step name.   Sami
I don't see an option to delete byte.

Styling of the login/"get started" modal. The modal is too big for a single input field.

# Signup/Login on Tidbitshub
We added feature to show the spaces created by him. If there is already one or more spaces created
by the user, we should show a list of spaces and let the user select one of them to login. Here we can show another
section which is another list, which "Admin of spaces", that allows user to select and login to that space. 

This will help achieve both the goals 
1) Signup and create space - already done
2) Login to selected space from tidbitshub.org - new feature

# View Tidbit Collections
- [ ] Have a way to separate the tidbits and clickable demos so that its clear to the user

# Post signup - Help text
- [ ] After the user signs up, We should probably show some help tidbits or a help Tidbit collection, which has
information related to what is tidbit, what is clickable demo, what is a collections, a short video etc
- [ ] This collection can have a couple of clickable demoes too

# Login issue for admins
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?

# Signup email text and styling
- [ ] The email that is sent to the user after signup should be styled properly.
- [ ] The email should have a proper subject line

# Home page styling
- Styling fixes for large screen as currently the content is not properly aligned
