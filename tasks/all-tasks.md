Must have features

# Demos Extension
- [ ] input still needs to be clicked more than once to get it into focus
- [ ] In extension when taking the screenshot, use height of viewport instead of the height of the page - Sami

# Clickable Demos
- [ ] Overlay shows over the buttons - Sami
- [ ] tooltips are not appearing correctly for the new iframe changes
- [ ] modal's cross button outline getting cutoff - (clickable demo view)
- [ ] we can show a "Try it" button when clickable demo gets completed which takes user to some link relevant to the demo
- [ ] upon completion, successful toast is missing just like the one on tidbit completion
- [ ] only looks fine above 1024px, down that its all a mess so we can detect the screen size and show a message like view the demo on a large screen
- [ ] Edit modal - bottom padding needs to be added to the box wrapper
- [ ] Edit modal - summary error should be changed from "Excerpt is required" to "Summary is required"
- [ ] Edit modal - add border to tooltip position dropdown


# Login issue for admins
- [ ] the admin is not able to login to the subdomain from list of spaces
- [ ] ellipsis not visible against tidbits on subdomain, when a user clicks on the space he is an admin of in the list - Dawood to verify
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
  May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?
- [ ] Go to /login on a subdomain:
  - [ ] if already logged in then welcome screen can look better
  - [ ] (for tidbitshub only) if not logged in then single section modal is showing but behind it Full Screen Modal is showing - just gotta make the single section modal background opacity-100 for this flow only

# Tidbits
- [ ] Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we 
can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new 
users - Skipped
- [ ] Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons - Skipped
- [ ] Edit modal - header should be "Edit Tidbit" instead of Edit Byte
- [ ] Edit modal - steps heading should be "Tidbit Steps" instead of Byte Steps
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - icon to duplicate a step 
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - if step content isnt mandatory then remove the star from heading "Step Content*"
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - bit of padding left & right for the closed accordion content (name+arrow)
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - add border to image display mode dropdown
- [ ] Edit modal - bottom padding needs to be added to the box wrapper
- [ ] Edit modal - name & summary field placeholder should use tidbit instead of byte
- [ ] Edit modal - errors should be consistent 
  - [ ] name error : Name is required
  - [ ] summary error with field: Summary is required and should be less than 64 characters long
  - [ ] summary error above upload button: Content cannot be empty.


# Short videos
- [ ] icon can be changed (its same as tidbit)
- [ ] when short video is opened, an ellipsis is shown with options (Edit, Edit SEO) but we dont have such ellipsis for tidbits/clickable demos
- [ ] when video has been watched, its icon doesnt change to a tick
- [ ] remove the priority field, its not working
- [ ] if mandatory field left empty and saved, shows error message with the field but doesnt show an error toast

# Tidbit Collections
- [ ] Have a way to separate the tidbits and clickable demos so that its clear to the user
- [ ] whole entity (tidbit/clickable demo/short video) tile should be clickable
- [ ] entity tile should change background color when hovered over
- [ ] input field background color has been messed up, its white everywhere 
- [ ] Archive notification needs to be updated from "Failed to archive ByteCollection" to "Failed to archive Tidbit Collection"
- [ ] If admin cant archive a collection then lets not show the option to
- [ ] Either we should use delete everywhere because archive means that there is a place where we can see all the archived ones
- [ ] Collection archive modal shows collection name but archive modal of other entities arent showing the entity name
- [ ] Ellipsis of an entity when opened, shows the ellipsis of the lower entity like its just appearing maybe due to z-index issue
