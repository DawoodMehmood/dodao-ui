Must have features



# 1st Priority

### Clickable Demos
- [ ] View modal - only looks fine above 1024px, down that its all a mess so we can detect the screen size and show a message like view the demo on a large screen
- [ ] Styling is not applied in injected iframes
- [ ] Tooltip is showing up twice

### Tidbits
- [ ] On small height screens and when the tidbit has many steps, the last few steps look very odd
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - delete modal says "Archive me" - change it to "Delete me"

# 2nd Priority

### Post signup - Help text
- [ ] Add couple of clickable demos. One for creating tidbit, and other for creating a clickable demo.


### Others
- [ ] Remove the hardcoded messages of notifications and errors. Make use of `default.json` file for all the messages 
- [ ] Add more preview items in Theme Settings modal to see the color changes

### Clickable Demos
- [ ] View modal - we can show a "Try it" button when clickable demo gets completed which takes user to some link relevant to the demo

### Tidbits
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - image uploader - if gif is uploaded, edit and trash icon doesnt appear 
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - icon to duplicate a step 
- [ ] Edit modal - in stepper - bit of padding left & right for the closed accordion content (name+arrow)
- [ ] Edit modal - Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we 
can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new 
users - Skipped
- [ ] Edit modal - Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons - Skipped
  
### Tidbit Collections
