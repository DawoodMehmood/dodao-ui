# View Clickable Demos
- [ ] The `trash` icon (for deleting) on the `Completion Screen` doesn't work.    Sami - Next
- [ ] Placeholders missing from fields in `Completion Screen` accordion.  Sami - Next
- [ ] Use slightly bigger font on the accordion where we are showing the step name.   Sami - Next
- [ ] I don't see an option to delete byte - Sami - Next

### Dawood - Next
- [ ] For the Delete Confirmation Modal, we need to pass the name of the entity also. This makes it clear to the user what he is deleting.    Dawood - Next




- [x] Are we using the priority and tags fields anywhere, if not, we can then remove them.    Sami
- [ ] Step Contents field could be made smaller.  Dawood - In Progress
- [ ] Upload image modal needs to be styled better.   Dawood - In Progress
- [x] We get these generic errors like `Validation Error: Can't Save Byte`, the user doesn't know what exactly is the error.
- [x] If a step has an error, it just shows `This step has an error`, doesn't really tell about the error. May be we should add real time validation and not wait until the user clicks on Upload button.     Sami
- [ ] Since we know the fields which has errors, above the save/update button, we can list down those fields with generic or a specific error message - Sami
- [ ] Instead of show an icon for `Add Input or Questions`, which on clicking shows a modal with various buttons, we can directly show these buttons below the `Step Content` field. This would make adding questions more explicit for new users.    Skipped
- [x] Hide the scrollbars from stepper accordion. Dawood - Done
- [x] Add hover tooltip on the icons on `Completion Screen` accordion.   Sami

- [] If the name of item is too long, the dropdown ellipses hide.
- [] Similar kind of validation to be added on Clickable demos.

Styling of the login/"get started" modal. The modal is too big for a single input field.

- [ ] Add some hovering effect on `Add Question`, `Move up`, `Move down`, and `Delete step` icons.    Skipped

# Signup/Login on Tidbitshub
We added feature to show the spaces created by him. If there is already one or more spaces created
by the user, we should show a list of spaces and let the user select one of them to login. Here we can show another
section which is another list, which "Admin of spaces", that allows user to select and login to that space. 

This will help achieve both the goals 
1) Signup and create space - already done
2) Login to selected space from tidbitshub.org - new feature

# View Tidbit Collections
- [ ] Have a way to separate the tidbits and clickable demos so that its clear to the user

# Post signup - Help text
- [ ] After the user signs up, We should probably show some help tidbits or a help Tidbit collection, which has
information related to what is tidbit, what is clickable demo, what is a collections, a short video etc
- [ ] This collection can have a couple of clickable demoes too

# Login issue for admins
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?
