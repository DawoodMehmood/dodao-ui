# Signup email text and styling
- [ ] The email that is sent to the user after signup should be styled properly.

information related to what is tidbit, what is clickable demo, what is a collections, a short video etc
- [ ] This collection can have a couple of clickable demoes too

# View Tidbit Collections

# View Clickable Demos
- [ ] When the demo is done show a green tick mark on the demo like we show on the completed tidbits

# Login issue for admins
- [ ] Making it easy for the admin to login. Right now we are not showing any login button.
May be we show in the footer? or somewhere else where its not too visible?

# Signup/Login on Tidbitshub
We added feature to show the spaces created by him. If there is already one or more spaces created
by the user, we should show a list of spaces and let the user select one of them to login. Here we can show another
section which is another list, which "Admin of spaces", that allows user to select and login to that space. 

This will help achieve both the goals 
1) Signup and create space - already done
2) Login to selected space from tidbitshub.org - new feature


Styling of the login/"get started" modal. The modal is too big for a single input field.


# Home page styling
- Styling fixes for large screen as currently the content is not properly aligned

# Creation/Editing Bytes
- [ ] The creation error is always the "oops something went wrong" should'nt it be specific.
- [ ] Also how would the new user know that what things he can add in the tidbit as i had to find the question adding 
option(solution we can add tooltips for the icons)
- [ ] The size of the text box is too large
- [ ] Full stepper needs adjustments to mae it look good
