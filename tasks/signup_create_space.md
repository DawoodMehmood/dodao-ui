# DoDAO UI Checklist

# Changes - Academy UI

- [ ] Add login option on subdomain
- [ ] Create finish setup space (space setup with logo, theme, and admin usernames) screen. The admin can come back and edit it.
- [ ] Edit space can have all the settings, and for now we don't need to show it to an admin. Only to super admin.
- [ ] Add profile edit page. Just name is needed on it, and may be avatar, and phone? Email/username is un-editable 

# Changes - Base UI
- [ ] reuse the create use form from the web-core
- [ ] reuse the create space form from the web-core
- [ ] reuse the finish-space-setup from the web-core
