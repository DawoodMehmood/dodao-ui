# DoDAO UI Checklist

# Changes - Academy UI

- [ ] Add login option on subdomain (Have to see whats the right approach)
- [ ] User log in on `tidbitshub.org` and then should be redirected to his space(subdomain)
- [x] Create finish setup space (space setup with logo, theme, and admin usernames) screen. The admin can come back and edit it.
- [x] Edit space can have all the settings, and for now we don't need to show it to an admin. Only to super admin.
- [x] Add profile edit page. Just name is needed on it, and may be avatar, and phone? Email/username is un-editable
