# Clickable demo issues

## In extension

- [ ] Input field (save file name) doesnt get into focus for typing. Have to click like 10 times
- [ ] Upon saving the file, 'Updating..' stops to happen if i dont stay on the same tab. But its not 100% sure
- [ ] Wording can be improved

## In platform

- [ ] Sometimes the 'Select' button doesnt get clicked
- [ ] The element selector doesnt have a button to unselect the selection
- [ ] The upload in element selector shows the captures but there isnt any button to delete those captures as i accidently saved some and they got clustered in there. Suggestion: We can have a small cross button on the top right of each capture.
- [ ] The element selector opens up pretty slow
- [ ] On UI, when we open a clickable demo, the second step doesnt show the tooltip on first attempt. If we close and opens again then it works.
- [ ] The time interval to show the tooltip can be reduced
