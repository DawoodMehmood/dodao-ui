### PolyMarket to Decentralized Rubrics
- Having skin in the game is very important.
- We can ask rubric's evaluator to put some money(bond) before they can evaluate.
- If their evaluation is not of good quality, they lose the bond. Else they get it back and some rewards for their good evaluation.
- This way we can have a decentralized review platform.
