# Background on Review Application
Rubric application was started for rating government's work. Then Robin had conversation with political science professors
and it was clear that its a huge huge scope, to bring in some impact and real change. 

We then decided to start with a simple decentralized rating and review platform.

### Users
This platform can be used in a few ways:
- For solutions to problems and review of those solutions
- For rating and reviews of things "Government Policies", "Corporate Policies(CSR)", "Financial Assets", "Crypto Projects", "Proposals", "Crowdfunding Projects", "IPOs", 
NGO, environment work, Carbon Credit Projects, etc.
  - NGOs - as natural calamities happen, those are NGOs are focused on. 
  - 

### Review Methods
Other things to note:
- We should not limit ourselves to just rubrics. Some of the other review methods that we should include are
  - Meets Criteria - Yes/No/Partially/Not Sure/Not Applicable
  - Checklists - Set of items that the things to be reviewed has to meet
  - Rubric - About quality of the thing to be reviewed

### Differentiation from other review platforms
- We should only focus on providing detailed reviews, which take more than 20 minutes for each evaluator.
- We ensure that the evaluator has skin in the game. This is done by asking them to put some money as bond before they can evaluate.
- We ensure that the evaluator is rewarded for their good evaluation.

### How Platform Works
- There will be a list of items that have to be reviewed. The items can already exist like when rating projects, 
proposals, or NGOs etc. Or the items can be created, as in the case of asking for solutions to a problem.
- The evaluator will have to put some money as bond before they can evaluate.
- The evaluator will evaluate the items based on the rubric.
- A different team will evaluate the evaluation of the evaluator. If the evaluation is not of good quality, the 
evaluator's bond will be lost. Else they will get the bond back and some rewards for their good evaluation.

# Bonding Mechanism
This bonding mechanism is a common layer than can be used by multiple applications. For example
- Please have problem commiting to group goals. You can put some money as bond and if you don't meet the goals, you lose the bond.
- Fitness goals
- Learning goals and incentives for kids
- Learning goals and incentives for employees
- Many free programs like Accelerator programs, Incubator programs, etc. can use this bonding mechanism to ensure that 
the participants are serious about the program.
  
# Why Decentralized Reviews?
Decentralized is a buzzword in the crypto world. But it has been very useful in a few cases. The application that has
influences creation of this decentralized rubrics application platform is is [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/).


### Polymarket
- There are thousands of news and polling agencies. Each with their own agenda.
- Betting money on the outcomes clearly shows ones true belief in the expected outcome.
- For this reason polymarket often has the most real predictable outcomes.

### PolyMarket to Decentralized Reviews
- Having skin in the game is very important.
- We can ask rubric's evaluator to put some money(bond) before they can evaluate.
- If their evaluation is not of good quality, they lose the bond. Else they get it back and some rewards for their good evaluation.
- This way we can have a decentralized review platform.
