# Hero Section
Get solutions or expert evaluations for your initiatives, projects, or proposals. Our decentralized platform ensures 
fair, thorough, and reliable assessments by requiring evaluators to have skin in the game, rewarding high-quality 
reviews, and penalizing dishonest or poor ones.

# How It Works – Getting Solutions
Our platform ensures transparency by requiring evaluators to stake real value in their work. Honest, high-quality 
solution or reviews are rewarded, while poor evaluations are penalized. This structure ensures that only reliable, thoughtful 
assessments contribute to decision-making.


### 1. Defining the Problem and Solution Criteria
Philanthropists, corporations, or governments can list specific challenges, such as climate change, healthcare, or 
income inequality. Along with the problem, they define solution criteria to ensure that proposed ideas are realistic 
and viable. Criteria may include budget limits, implementation timelines, and other constraints essential to meet their goals.

### 2. Submitting Solutions
Experts, or individuals submit detailed proposals. Each solution can include supporting materials such as 
research data, references, or prototypes to make the case stronger.

### 3. Screening for Relevant Solutions
A team reviews and removes irrelevant or poorly aligned solutions to maintain efficiency. The number 
of shortlisted solutions depends on the problem publisher’s preferences, budget, number of evaluators, and the reward 
structure for evaluations.

### 4. Evaluation Process
Selected evaluators, carefully chosen for their expertise, assess the shortlisted solutions using a **rubric + checklist**. 
Each evaluator is required to place a bond to ensure commitment. Evaluators consider factors like feasibility, 
innovation, impact, and alignment with the problem criteria during their assessment.

### 5. Rewards and Accountability
Evaluators who submit high-quality assessments receive their bond back, along with a reward. If the evaluation is 
subpar or dishonest, the evaluator loses the bond, promoting fairness and accountability across the platform.

### 6. Decision and Implementation
Based on the evaluations, the philanthropist or organization selects the best solution. This ensures that only thoughtful, 
impactful solutions are prioritized, allowing for smooth implementation aligned with the predefined criteria.

## How It Works – Reviews

### 1. Creating Review Campaigns
Organizations, investors, or governments submit items to be reviewed. These can include financial assets like IPOs or 
crowdfunding projects, CSR initiatives, NGOs, or government policies.

### 2. Setting Up the Review Structure
The platform offers several ways to structure reviews. A **rubric** provides detailed scoring criteria. A **checklist** 
ensures that essential requirements are met. A **meets criteria** framework allows for quick assessments using 
Yes/No/Partially answers.

### 3. Evaluator Participation
Evaluators interested in participating must place a bond before starting their review. This ensures they have a stake 
in the process and are committed to providing thoughtful evaluations.

### 4. Conducting Reviews
Evaluators assess the submitted items based on the chosen framework. They consider factors like quality, alignment with 
goals, and overall impact during their evaluations.

### 5. Ensuring Review Integrity
The platform performs a second-level review of the evaluators’ work. Evaluators who provide high-quality, unbiased 
assessments get their bond back along with a reward. If the evaluation is poor or dishonest, the evaluator loses their bond.


# Our Aim - Shaping the Future of Governance

TODO - Make it generic and use "Public Projects" instead of "Government Policies"

Governments don’t operate in absolutes—policies exist on a spectrum, with people agreeing with some and opposing others.

While democracy remains the most effective form of government, its processes are built on centuries-old systems.

With today’s tools, citizens can engage more meaningfully—participating in policy decisions, influencing spending, and 
offering practical solutions. 

Our mission is to become the go-to platform for governments to find innovative solutions and receive transparent feedback 
on their policies, ensuring continuous improvement throughout their term.
