### Include Photos on Tidbit Steps

Right now photos can be included in the markdown and we can show them, but the person needs to find the photos, and
have to upload them. So to simplify it we want to provide ways to include photos. For this we can

1. Generate images using Dalle 3
2. Include some functionality to search and include videos via google. Check copyright issues
3. See any other providers like istockphoto.com
