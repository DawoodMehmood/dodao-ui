### Alternative views for Tidbits
Right now we have a step-by-step view for Tidbits. We can also have a accordion view, or a carousel view etc.
- As we scroll the page, the step should be switch, this prevents any clicking
- Auto play the steps
- For the current steps show a right bar with all the steps, and the current step should be highlighted and
  as the steps are completed, they should be marked as completed.
