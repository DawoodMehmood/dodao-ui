### Social Sharing on Twitter/Linkedin
We should be able to share the Tidbit on Twitter and Linkedin.
1. For linked in we can show a carousel
2. For Twitter we can show an image which includes all steps, or a long post
   We can also try to integrate with huitsuite or some other Saas solution which allows us to publish the content to the
   social media platforms
