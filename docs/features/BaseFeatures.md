# Background on Base Application
Base Application is a web application that provides a foundation for building web applications that we plan to create 
in DoDAO. This will allow us to create a completely new application(MVP) in a matter of days.

The application is built using Next.js, Prisma, and Postgres and is deployed on Vercel. 

Below are some of the features of the application

### Authentication
This makes sure the user can signup and login to the application. We need to provide support for both web2 and web3
authentication.

### Space Creation
- This allows the user to create a space. 
- Creation of a sub-domain for the space.
- Update theme during/after creation of the space.

### Admin Screens
- Admin screens for the space
  - Update basic information
  - Add custom domain
  - Update theme
- Admin screen for the user's profile

### Account Abstraction Wallets
There are the new type wallets/accounts that are added in the ethereum and we need to see which providers can we use
to support these wallets.
