# Background on Review Application
Rubric application was started for rating government's work. Then Robin had conversation with political science professors
and it was clear that its a huge huge scope, to bring in some impact and real change. 

We then decided to start with a simple decentralized rating and review platform.

### Users
This platform can be used in a few ways:
- For solutions to problems and review of those solutions
- For rating and reviews of things "Financial Assets", "Crypto Projects", "Proposals", "Crowdfunding Projects", "IPOs", 
NGO, environment work, etc.

### Review Methods
Other things to note:
- We should not limit ourselves to just rubrics. Some of the other review methods that we should include are
  - Meets Criteria - Yes/No/Partially/Not Sure/Not Applicable
  - Checklists - Set of items that the things to be reviewed has to meet
  - Rubric - About quality of the thing to be reviewed

### Differentiation from other review platforms
- We should only focus on providing detailed reviews, which take more than 20 minutes for each evaluator.
- We ensure that the evaluator has skin in the game. This is done by asking them to put some money as bond before they can evaluate.
- We ensure that the evaluator is rewarded for their good evaluation.

### How Platform Works
- There will be a list of items that have to be reviewed. The items can already exist like when rating projects, 
proposals, or NGOs etc. Or the items can be created, as in the case of asking for solutions to a problem.
- The evaluator will have to put some money as bond before they can evaluate.
- The evaluator will evaluate the items based on the rubric.
- A different team will evaluate the evaluation of the evaluator. If the evaluation is not of good quality, the 
evaluator's bond will be lost. Else they will get the bond back and some rewards for their good evaluation.


  
# Why Decentralized Reviews?
Decentralized is a buzzword in the crypto world. But it has been very useful in a few cases. The application that has
influences creation of this decentralized rubrics application platform is is [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/).


### Polymarket
- There are thousands of news and polling agencies. Each with their own agenda.
- Betting money on the outcomes clearly shows ones true belief in the expected outcome.
- For this reason polymarket often has the most real predictable outcomes.

### PolyMarket to Decentralized Reviews
- Having skin in the game is very important.
- We can ask rubric's evaluator to put some money(bond) before they can evaluate.
- If their evaluation is not of good quality, they lose the bond. Else they get it back and some rewards for their good evaluation.
- This way we can have a decentralized review platform.

# Opportunities

### For rich philanthropists who want to get solutions and validation on solutions for a specific problem
- Currently there is a huge divide in left and right. There is no clear solution for things like income inequality, 
climate change, homosexuality, abortion, Ukraine war, Israel-Palestinian conflict, crime, drug addiction, etc.
- Rich philanthropists can use this platform mention the problem and ask for solutions. They can put money out for the 
best solution.
- There are three actors in this case. The philanthropist, the evaluators, and the solution providers.
- The evaluators will be carefully selected by us. 
- The evaluation will be on a checklist + rubric.

##### Challenges
- How to get started? How do we get the first philanthropist?

### NGOs, Governments, and Public Departments
Exactly the same as above.
