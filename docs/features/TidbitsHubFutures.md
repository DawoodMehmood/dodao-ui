# Vision

Every website needs to share some information or educate its users. They way they try to do it using blogs, user & 
tech docs, or videos. Which these are good, they require dedicated time to read and they users normally are looking for 
quick information. This is the reason Youtube shorts, reels, or twitter have gained so much popularity.

With GenerativeAI demand for crisp content with further increase and we are in a good position to provide that.
