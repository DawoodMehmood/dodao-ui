# Getting Solutions for Specific Problems
For rich philanthropists who want to get solutions and validation on solutions for a specific problem
- Currently there is a huge divide in left and right. There is no clear solution for things like income inequality,
  climate change, homosexuality, abortion, Ukraine war, Israel-Palestinian conflict, crime, drug addiction, etc.
- Rich philanthropists can use this platform mention the problem and ask for solutions. They can put money out for the
  best solution.
- There are three actors in this case. The philanthropist, the evaluators, and the solution providers.
- The evaluators will be carefully selected by us.
- The evaluation will be on a checklist + rubric.

##### Challenges
- How to get started? How do we get the first philanthropist?
